Melissa McLaren's Introduction
 Hi! My name is Melissa, but I generally go by Lissy. Dungeons and Dragons would be my favourite hobby at the moment, I'm currently playing two campaigns, twice a week with friends.
 My favourite aspect of IT is the hardware, if that counts. I've loved learning about it over the past few years and I really enjoy taking apart and building computers.
 I took Vocational Skills because it was compulsory for me after CITSS, although it is a class I would have chosen in year 2 anyway.
